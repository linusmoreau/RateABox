### We Rate Boxes!

RateABox is an application for practicing perspective drawing with one of the simplest shapes: a box! 

After drawing nine (9) lines (the number of edges visible on a box), your box will be provided a rating.
The lower the number, the better the box adheres to perspective rules.
